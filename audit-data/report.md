# Protocol Summary

A smart contract applicatoin for storing a password. Users should be able to store a password and then retrieve it later. Others should not be able to access the password.

# Disclaimer

The team makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
|            |        | High   | Medium | Low |
|            | High   | H      | H/M    | M   |
| Likelihood | Medium | H/M    | M      | M/L |
|            | Low    | M      | M/L    | L   |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.


## Scope 

```
./src/
 PasswordStore.sol
```


## Roles

- Owner: The user who can set the password and read the password.
- Outsides: No one else should be able to set or read the password.

# Findings

### [H-1] Storing password on chain makes it visible to everyone and it's no longer private

**Likelihood & Impact**
-Impact: HIGH
-Likelihood: HIGH
-Severity: CRITICAL

**Description:** All data stored on chain is visible to anyone and can be read directly from the blockchain. The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be a private variable and only accessed through `PasswordStore::getPassword` function, which is intended to be called by the owner of the contract.

**Impact:** Anyone can read the private password, severly breaking the functionality of the protocol.

**Proof of Concept:**The below test case shows how anyone could read the password directly from the blockchain. We use [foundry's cast](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) tool to read directly from the storage of the contract, without being the owner. 

1. Create a locally running chain
```bash
make anvil
```

2. Deploy the contract to the chain

```
make deploy 
```

3. Run the storage tool

We use `1` because that's the storage slot of `s_password` in the contract.

```
cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

You'll get an output that looks like this:

`0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

You can then parse that hex to a string with:

```
cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```

And get an output of:

```
myPassword
```


**Recommended Mitigation:** Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought. One could encrypt the password off-chain, and then store the encrypted password on-chain. This would require the user to remember another password off-chain to decrypt the password. However, you'd also likely want to remove the view function as you wouldn't want the user to accidentally send a transaction with the password that decrypts your password. 

### [H-2] `PasswordStore::setPassword` has no access control. A non-owner can set passwords.

**Likelihood & Impact**
-Impact: HIGH
-Likelihood: HIGH
-Severity: CRITICAL

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is set to be an `external` function, however the natspec of the function and overall purpose of the smart contract is that `This function allows only the owner to set a new password.`

```
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
     // @audit - There are no access controls here
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

**Impact:** Anyone can set/change the password of the contract.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following to PasswordStore.t.sol to verify.

```
function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {

        vm.assume(randomAddress != owner);
        vm.prank(randomAddress);
        string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
        passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);

        vm.prank(owner);
        string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
        assertEq(expectedPassword, actualPassword);
    }    
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add an access control conditional to the `setPassword` function

```
if(msg.sender != owner) {
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
}
```

### [I-3] The `PasswordStore::getPassword` natspec indicates a parameter that doesn't exist, causing the natspec to be incorrect

**Description:** 

**Likelihood & Impact**
-Impact: NONE
-Likelihood: HIGH
-Severity: INFO

```javascript
    /*
     * @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
@>   * @param newPassword The new password to set.
     */
    function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {
```

The natspec for the function `PasswordStore::getPassword` indicates it should have a parameter with the signature `getPassword(string)`. However, the actual function signature is `getPassword()`.

**Impact:** The natspec is incorrect.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the incorrect natspec line.

```diff
-     * @param newPassword The new password to set.
```
